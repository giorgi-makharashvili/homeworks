        <h2><strong>Introduction to Basketball</strong></h2>
        <section>Basketball is one of the most popular and exciting sports in the world, played and loved by millions. <br>
            It involves two teams of five players each, competing to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing team’s hoop. <br>
            Originating in 1891, basketball has evolved into a global phenomenon, with professional leagues in every corner of the globe. <br>
            The game requires a unique blend of skills, including shooting, dribbling, passing, and defending. <br>
            Whether you are a casual fan or a hardcore player, basketball offers something for everyone.</section>

        <h2><strong>The Basics of the Game</strong></h2>
        <section>At its core, basketball is a fast-paced game of strategy, teamwork, and athleticism. <br>
            Each team aims to score by shooting the basketball through the hoop, which is 10 feet above the ground. <br>
            A basket is worth two points, or three points if shot from beyond the three-point line. <br>
            The game is played in four quarters, and the team with the most points at the end wins. <br>
            Players must work together to move the ball up and down the court, pass to teammates, <br>
            and create scoring opportunities while defending against the opposition.</section>
